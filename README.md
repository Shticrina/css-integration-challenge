# HTML CSS Evaluation

###  Consolidation Challenge 1: ***Html Css integration***

In this exercise, we will build a full integration of 3 mockups, step by step. We will create one html page and one css file.
We will add the relevant html and css code so that the final result looks exactly as the provided high-fidelity mockup images.
Also, we have to make it responsive.
